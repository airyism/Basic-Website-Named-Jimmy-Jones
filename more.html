<p> My name is Kimi. I was born in 2/2/11 somewhere around Fort Lauderdale, Florida, U.S.A. Growing up, I've always seen myself as a hobbyist. Currently, I have experience in topics such as math, biology, language-learning, art, ect. What I've just listed are what I'm both good at and what matters in the professional field. Outside of that, I like reading, music, watching web series, karaoke, pandas, and I've began to learn how to use HTML.  </p>

<p> My favorite food is wing stop fries. </p>
